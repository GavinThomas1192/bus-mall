Part of your assignment today is to write your own user stories. Be sure to consider the multiple roles involved: the marketing research team, the developer, and the focus group participant who will be using the application. Try to write 4-5 user stories for each role. DO THIS STEP FIRST in a file called user_stories.md. The commit logs in your repo will have a first couple of commits for the scaffolding process, but next you should have a 'user stories' commit that is in place before any code is written.

#Project Outcomes Per Department:

#Marketing
As successful completion of this project the marketing department will take the data received from random participants and use it to choose which products we will send to production for creation. Marketing should choose items the participants found most desirable based on the statistics provided from the developer's web page. It is important that the information provided to the marketing department clearly details all products and the amount of times a study participant chose the item. It is vital that the data clearly shows those items chosen by the study participants not only more often but in relation to the amount of times the item was shown.

#Developer
As the developer receiving this job from a company I have many tasks. My final outcome will start with a clean webpage orientated towards the study group participants. The website should be clean, neat, with dull colors in order not to distract from the participants distraction level.
I will make all item choices appear to be the same size, even in shape, and completely random. I will show the participants 3 different pictures of potential production items. When the user clicks a new set of three different images will appear until the user clicks a total of 25 times. After 25 selections the user will be informed that they have completed the study.

#Developer2
As a developer taking over this project for bus_mall I hope that the JS code is neat, DRY, and follows basic order. I would hope that all objects are stored in a clean Array with a single object constructor. I would hope that the previous dev left detailed console logs explaining what and why. I would hope the previous dev also left detailed comments in the actual code.

#As The Participant
As the participant I want to be clearly instructed on what to do. If at all possible I would like to know why I am doing what I am doing. As the participant I want the website to be easy to use, read, and see. I want the directions clearly written out for me and don't want to accidentally break something. I would like to know when I am done with the test and if at all possible how many clicks I have until I'm done. I would like to know if this test is timed.
